### 1. Run OpenAI Whisper
## Setup

We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI's tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command:

    pip install -U openai-whisper

Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies:

    pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 

To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run:

    pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git

It also requires the command-line tool [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/)
choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
scoop install ffmpeg
```
